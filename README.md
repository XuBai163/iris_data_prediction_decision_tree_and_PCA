# iris_data_prediction_with_decision_tree
Decision tree is used to make predictions on different types of iris. The project is taught by Flare Zhao in his course, "Python 3 Intro to Artificial Intelligence".

The original data of iris is composed of: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the class label. 

A decision tree was trained on these sets of data, prediction was made and evaluated. The tree is also visualized.
