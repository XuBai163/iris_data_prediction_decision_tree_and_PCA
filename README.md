# iris_data_prediction_with_decision_tree
Decision tree is used to make predictions on different types of iris. The project is taught by Flare Zhao in his course, "Python 3 Intro to Artificial Intelligence".

The original data of iris is composed of: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the class label. 

"predict_iris_data_decision_tree.ipynb":
A decision tree was trained on these sets of data, prediction was made and evaluated. The tree is also visualized. 

"iris_data_prediction_with_PCA_and_KNN":
The dimension of the iris datasets was reduced from 4 to 2, after pca analysis. A slight decrease in KNN prediction is spotted.
